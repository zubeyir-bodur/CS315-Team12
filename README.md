# CS315-Team12 Glide
This project is forked from [cirillannon](https://www.github.com/cirillannon). It is a programming language intended to program drones. It currently has its lexical analyizer & parser working. However, the language feels weak: there is no named constants, types, actions... It is just scanner and parser all by itself. I'm currently planning to improve the following features: Operator precedence, seperating boolean & algebraic expressions, adding types for expressions, improving the syntax error message and more.
